### Automatic Tax Calculation
- **Intrastate Transactions**: Automatically applies CGST + SGST when buyer and seller are in the same state
- **Interstate Transactions**: Automatically applies IGST when buyer and seller are in different states


## Usage Examples

### Intrastate Transaction
- **Scenario**: Hospital in Maharashtra billing patient in Maharashtra
- **Tax Application**: CGST (9%) + SGST (9%) = 18%
- **Display**: Shows separate CGST and SGST components

### Interstate Transaction
- **Scenario**: Hospital in Maharashtra billing patient in Gujarat
- **Tax Application**: IGST (18%)
- **Display**: Shows IGST component only
